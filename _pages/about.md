PhD researcher in Interaction Design specialising in Human-AI interaction and co-creation within creative practices such as music composition. Current interests are in designing for reflection, engagement, creativity, and education. 

My most recent work has been centred around block-based creativity support tools for music composition, --- specifically, using these to explore collaborations between people and generative AI systems.

**Areas:** Music Technology, Interaction Design, Computer-Supported Education, Music Composition, Generative Music, Digital and Computational Creativity, Explainable AI, Machine Learning, NIME, C++
