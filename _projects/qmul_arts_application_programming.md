<b>For the BSc (Hons) Creative Computing and BEng (Hons) Design, Innovation & Creative Engineering degrees @ Queen Mary University of London. </b>

The aim of the module is to introduce programming through visual design and focuses on what computer programmes can do - i.e. the applications that can be developed - and use this to extract key structures and features of the chosen programming language (Processing/Java). The module focuses as much on the creativity of ideas as on how to write code to realise these ideas.
